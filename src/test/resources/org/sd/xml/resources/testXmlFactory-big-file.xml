   <d:Title>Anaar</d:Title>
   <d:Description>While the ambience at this cozy little restaurant is great, there really is a long way to go before they can call themselves a well-run establishment. The walls look inviting and warm, covered with carpets designed by the owner (all for sale), but in the winter take your own heater.

The food varies widely and while there are certainly good days, it does seem to make foreigners ill all too often. </d:Description>

   <d:Title>B&#039;s Is Good Home Cooking</d:Title>
   <d:Description>B&#039;s opened for business in June of 2002 -- just as the Loya Jirga that confirmed Hamid Karzai as Transitional Authority president was completed. Inside of the walled complex where this restaurant is located, there are lots of pine trees and real green grass. This is a nice break from dusty Kabul -- without having to leave Kabul. The chef&#039;s dish of the day is usually excellent. They have nice thick juicy steaks too, as well as fresh made pasta. If you&#039;re looking to escape from the repetition of endless routine of kebabs, tread bread and rice soaked in ghee with raisins and carrots, well, this is about as close to European eating that you can get in Kabul. And the idea of service also doesn&#039;t get much better than this in Afghanistan. </d:Description>

   <d:Title>Not bad at all</d:Title>
   <d:Description>Outdoor dining in the summer with very little lighting helps overlook the lacking decor - but even in the winter when you sit inside in very basic surroundings, the food is not bad at all.

With Kabul International and Anaar as the only competition for Indian food in Kabul - Delhi Darbar is miles ahead. Definitely worth a trip. And the staff is very helpful. </d:Description>

   <d:Description>My encounter at the restaurant was the last one I will ever have. I went with my wife, and we recieved minimal attention. Noticed that all the attention was being given to people that were not East Indian. Ordered 2 Tandoori Roti. Maybe it was the owner that served us , he only brought us a really dry one.  I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals. It took awfully long for the food to come which was not re-heated properly. So it was re-heated food and not fresh. I&#039;ve been to many Indian restaurants and this one was not one I would even consider going to again. I don&#039;t know why but a lot of the East Indian Restaurants think they should not focus on their East Indian customers. They have the misconception that we don&#039;t tip. That day I only tipped 2 dollars as a result of my experiece, normally I give 15-20%. My message is to let owners know that if I have a good experience I will let all my multicultural friends to go their.</d:Description>

   <d:Title>Outstanding Service, Food, a piece of history</d:Title>
   <d:Description>This was reportably where Osama Bin Laden kept his forth wife before fleeing during 2001.  It is appropriate named from the last stand of the British 44th Regiment at Gandamak pass during the 1st Afghan war.  A true 5 star guest lodge and restuarant, with outstanding, interesting and engaging hosts to boot!!
Tour the armoury and see the huge display of British antique fire arms.  If I go to Kabul again, I Gandamak will be my first choice!</d:Description>

   <d:Description>While the ambience at this cozy little restaurant is great, there really is a long way to go before they can call themselves a well-run establishment. The walls look inviting and warm, covered with carpets designed by the owner (all for sale), but in the winter take your own heater.

The food varies widely and while there are certainly good days, it does seem to make foreigners ill all too often. </d:Description>

   <d:Title>B&#039;s Is Good Home Cooking</d:Title>
   <d:Description>B&#039;s opened for business in June of 2002 -- just as the Loya Jirga that confirmed Hamid Karzai as Transitional Authority president was completed. Inside of the walled complex where this restaurant is located, there are lots of pine trees and real green grass. This is a nice break from dusty Kabul -- without having to leave Kabul. The chef&#039;s dish of the day is usually excellent. They have nice thick juicy steaks too, as well as fresh made pasta. If you&#039;re looking to escape from the repetition of endless routine of kebabs, tread bread and rice soaked in ghee with raisins and carrots, well, this is about as close to European eating that you can get in Kabul.

   <d:Description>My encounter at the restaurant was the last one I will ever have. I went with my wife, and we recieved minimal attention. Noticed that all the attention was being given to people that were not East Indian. Ordered 2 Tandoori Roti. Maybe it was the owner that served us , he only brought us a really dry one.  I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals. It took awfully long for the food to come which was not re-heated properly. So it was re-heated food and not fresh. I&#039;ve been to many Indian restaurants and this one was not one I would even consider going to again. I don&#039;t know why but a lot of the East Indian Restaurants think they should not focus on their East Indian customers. They have the misconception that we don&#039;t tip. That day I only tipped 2 dollars as a result of my experiece, normally I give 15-20%. My message is to let owners know that if I have a good experience I will let all my multicultural friends to go their.</d:Description>

The walls look inviting and warm, covered with carpets designed by the owner (all for sale), but in the winter take your own heater.

   <d:Description>B&#039;s opened for business in June of 2002 -- just as the Loya Jirga that confirmed Hamid Karzai as Transitional Authority president was completed.

   <d:Title>Low rating</d:Title>
   <d:Description>My encounter at the restaurant was the last one I will ever have. I went with my wife, and we recieved minimal attention. Noticed that all the attention was being given to people that were not East Indian. Ordered 2 Tandoori Roti. Maybe it was the owner that served us , he only brought us a really dry one.  I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals. It took awfully long for the food to come which was not re-heated properly. So it was re-heated food and not fresh. I&#039;ve been to many Indian restaurants and this one was not one I would even consider going to again. I don&#039;t know why but a lot of the East Indian Restaurants think they should not focus on their East Indian customers. They have the misconception that we don&#039;t tip. That day I only tipped 2 dollars as a result of my experiece, normally I give 15-20%. My message is to let owners know that if I have a good experience I will let all my multicultural friends to go their.</d:Description>

I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals.

   <d:Description>My encounter at the restaurant was the last one I will ever have. I went with my wife, and we recieved minimal attention. Noticed that all the attention was being given to people that were not East Indian. Ordered 2 Tandoori Roti. Maybe it was the owner that served us , he only brought us a really dry one.  I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals. It took awfully long for the food to come which was not re-heated properly. So it was re-heated food and not fresh. I&#039;ve been to many Indian restaurants and this one was not one I would even consider going to again. I don&#039;t know why but a lot of the East Indian Restaurants think they should not focus on their East Indian customers. They have the misconception that we don&#039;t tip. That day I only tipped 2 dollars as a result of my experiece, normally I give 15-20%. My message is to let owners know that if I have a good experience I will let all my multicultural friends to go their.</d:Description>

   <d:Title>Not bad at all</d:Title>
   <d:Description>Outdoor dining in the summer with very little lighting helps overlook the lacking decor - but even in the winter when you sit inside in very basic surroundings, the food is not bad at all.

With Kabul International and Anaar as the only competition for Indian food in Kabul - Delhi Darbar is miles ahead. Definitely worth a trip. And the staff is very helpful. </d:Description>

With Kabul International and Anaar as the only competition for Indian food in Kabul - Delhi Darbar is miles ahead. Definitely worth a trip. And the staff is very helpful. </d:Description>

   <d:Title>The best I ever got!</d:Title>
   <d:Description>As far as the restaurant is concerned I&#039;m totally satisfied with the food. I mean in a country where you hardly find anything good for your mouth,it&#039;s the best ever. In short: best, good care, warm people, feels like home because it&#039;s totally Indian! Give a trip because it&#039;s worth it!</d:Description>

   <d:Title>Low rating</d:Title>
   <d:Description>My encounter at the restaurant was the last one I will ever have. I went with my wife, and we recieved minimal attention. Noticed that all the attention was being given to people that were not East Indian. Ordered 2 Tandoori Roti. Maybe it was the owner that served us , he only brought us a really dry one.  I asked him three times for my second one , seemed like he did not bother to bring it. At the end I told him to cancel the second one as we had already finished our meals. It took awfully long for the food to come which was not re-heated properly. So it was re-heated food and not fresh. I&#039;ve been to many Indian restaurants and this one was not one I would even consider going to again. I don&#039;t know why but a lot of the East Indian Restaurants think they should not focus on their East Indian customers. They have the misconception that we don&#039;t tip. That day I only tipped 2 dollars as a result of my experiece, normally I give 15-20%. My message is to let owners know that if I have a good experience I will let all my multicultural friends to go their.</d:Description>

   <d:Title>Outstanding Service, Food, a piece of history</d:Title>
   <d:Description>This was reportably where Osama Bin Laden kept his forth wife before fleeing during 2001.  It is appropriate named from the last stand of the British 44th Regiment at Gandamak pass during the 1st Afghan war.  A true 5 star guest lodge and restuarant, with outstanding, interesting and engaging hosts to boot!!
Tour the armoury and see the huge display of British antique fire arms.  If I go to Kabul again, I Gandamak will be my first choice!</d:Description>
